 A little retrospection shows that although many fine, useful software systems
have been designed by committees and built as part of multipart projects,
those software systems that have excited passionate fans are those that are
the products of one or a few designing minds, great designers.  Consider Unix,
APL, Pascal, Modula, the Smalltalk interface, even Fortran; and contrast them
with Cobol, PL/I, Algol, MVS/370, and MS-DOS.

A nobler grave than this;

	As to take out and wave
The distinguishing mark of his sex at her.

 Q: I cant spell worth a dam.  I hope your going too tell me what to do?

A: Don't worry about how your articles look.  Remember it's the message
that counts, not the way it's presented.  Ignore the fact that sloppy
spelling in a purely written forum sends out the same silent messages that
soiled clothing would when addressing an audience.

Their topics run chiefly to sex.

	And masculine urgin's,
And other erotic effects.

 A gentleman, otherwise meek,
Detested with passion the leek;
	When offered one out
	He dealt such a clout
To the maid, she was down for a week.
